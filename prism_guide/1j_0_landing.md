# The Landing

The doors gently close behind the visitors. Directly opposite is a spiral staircase going upward. Beneath the spiral staircase is a trap door going downward.

In the center of the Landing is a podium of dark wood. Atop the podium is a brass bell tied to the podium with a fine golden chain.

## Layout

### Room details

The Landing is a small area, magically adjusting its size for the number of visitors. It is round, with a radius of one pace per visitor plus a pace for the Gate Keeper.

The Landing is the true center of the Prism and is lightly disposed toward Within.

No additional rooms are in the Landing.

## Egress

The Gate Keeper will grant egress via the staircase or trap door, but the entryway grants free access out of the Prism.

## Puzzle: The Desire Of One's Heart

A gentle Orange glow emanates from the podium as the Gate Keeper stands behind it. Glowing glyphs reveal the personal details, desires, and motives of each each being within the Landing.

The puzzle is initiated by delivering to the Gate Keeper the desire of it's heart.

## Boss: The Gate Keeper

The Gate Keeper is a calming presence. It's eyes are gray-blue and it's skin is a cold, pale hue. It never opens its mouth and makes only slow, calculated, intentional movements. It wears a silken cloak which always appears stationary despite any of the Gate Keepers movements.

The Gate Keeper is physical balance personified. As the first contact of the Prism, it is disposed toward Without.

Summoned by the ringing of the podium bell.

    As the bell sings out, the torches dim and the room grows gray. The note silences and standing behind the podium is the silent Gate Keeper.

Non-combative attitude.

Weighs the hearts of visitors and allows them upward or downward. Will only do this upon receipt of a gift, which will be used in determining the outcome of the weighing of the hearts.

Defeating the Gate Keeper inflicts a curse on the one who inflicts the final blow.

    The Gate Keeper lies still upon the ground, then slowly fades to nothingness. In its place you make out a fine golden chain, just like the one tying the bell to the podium. You trace the origin of this new chain to the podium, and as your eyes follow it from the podium to find the other end you see the other end is firmly bound around your heart. You feel peace, for you are balance. You now see the true nature of those whom you called comrades--visitors. Visitors to the Prism. How will you judge them?
