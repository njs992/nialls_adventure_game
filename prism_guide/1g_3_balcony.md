# The Balcony

The guests walk out onto the Balcony. A peaceful spot, often visited by the residents of the Above for secretive meetings and discussions.

## Layout

### Room details

The Balcony surrounds the Prism with accommodations for many people and parties. Small tables with chairs, pleasant floral arrangements on the railing, and a bar on the North face.

The sun fills the vast balcony. The disposition of the Balcony changes depending on the season.

No one on the balcony is openly or readily hostile, but you never know who you'll run into.

## Egress

The door downward is openly accessible, as is the gate into Keystadt Above.

The path upward begins here through what the Barkeep calls Sublimation.

### Sublimation

Sublimation is the simple process for accessing the upper floors, though it will block the guest from accessing anything beyond that.

Upon ingesting the Barkeep's Salve the way forward is made known. Glyphs on the floor lead the guests into a secret room, accessed via what appears to be a solid marble wall. A question is then posed to the guests, and they will choose between three doors:

* The correct door reveals a stair upward.
* The incorrect door leads out onto the Balcony.
* The bad door sends the guests into the Labyrinth, where the Beast Man will be able to actively track their location.

## Puzzle: Natural Passage

The puzzle of the Balcony grants access beyond the path upward by avoiding Sublimation.

The guests must learn and analyze the ingredients of the Barkeep's salve and then independently act in place of those ingredients.

The ingredients of the Salve can be identified in one of a few ways.

1. Ascertaining the list from the Barkeep via persuasion or defeating her.
2. Deconstituting a Salve. If seen, this is viewed as a hostile act by the Barkeep and she will not serve drinks to any of the guests in future visits to the Balcony.
3. Discovering the ingredients in the Within closet of the library.

The Salve contains 3 ingredients.These must be replaced using 3 different methods of invocation. Each ingredient represents a different symbol.

1. Guidance
    1. Root -> Remind
    2. Algae -> Feel
    3. Vegetable -> Vision
    4. Fern -> Resolve
2. Pass
    1. Fish -> Materialize
    2. Bee -> Shift
    3. Rat -> Phase
    4. Vulture -> Raise
3. Discern
    1. Nut -> South
    2. Fungus -> West
    3. Herb -> East
    4. Tree -> North

Using the proper spell at each stage will allow the guests to continue. If the same type of invocation is used twice, the puzzle is failed immediately and the rest will not work. This means the party may walk into a wall or have to randomly select a door. The Barkeep will be made aware and the attempt, the guests will be thrown out the Above gate, and they may have difficulty getting on her good side again.

## Boss: The Barkeep

The Barkeep can always be found behind the bar at the Balcony. She's knowledgeable on many social subjects and generally willing to share--if you can pay the price. What does she deal in? Information.

She is disposed to Within.

Non-combative attitude.

She is not easily provoked, though she always has a small legion of special Prism Guards within earshot. She is serious about theft and lies. She is a master of Subtlety.

Defeating her is brings notoriety. The victorious guests will gain access to the drink mix book but will then lose the trust of every bar tender in Keystadt--from the depths Below to the highest spots Above and everywhere around.

At her demise, one of her sisters fills the empty position.

Defeating a second sister gains the guest wanted status in all of Keystadt.

Defeating a third sister will gain the guest some sort of legendary status.
