# The Prism

The Prism is a tower found at the core of Keystadt. Crystal windows run up the walls like veins, glowing different colors by the time and season. It stretches as high as the eye can see and as deep as one can dig. It pierces through the fabric of reality and binds existence together.

An expedition into the Prism will generally be a self-contained adventure with puzzles and combat on each floor, and is the basis for most one-shots in NAG.
