# The Garden

When a wanderer enters the Garden by any means, they are greeted by immaculately groomed vegetation. Wide, clear windows bathe the Garden in rich light of every color, constantly shifting hues. Winged beauties and golden fawns eye the wanderers, crimson wine flows from fountains, and vibrant fruit hangs from the tree branches.

The Garden leans toward Without.

## Layout

### Room details

The Garden is divided into four sections. Each section is a wide open area with hostile protectors and few obstructions. Thick vines obscure the location of the doors.

## Egress

The wanderers can easily cut the vines that obscure the way back, but the way forward only makes itself known when all hostile creatures are cleared.

## Puzzle: Harpy's Heaven

When the wanderer ascends to the home of the winged beauty, they are greeted by a small troupe of musicians. The Seven Harps of Harpy's Heaven.

Each of the Seven desires something, but each can only voice what another wants. The puzzle is a riddle of ordering and delivering.

## Boss: The Carnivore Plant

The garden monster Carnivore Plant only emerges when it is properly fertilized.

To summon, ask the Barkeep for a potion. She will lead the wanderer to it's ingredients and then supply the concoction.

The Carnivore Plant is always hostile.

The Carnivore Plant is disposed Without and will only appear when the Garden bathes in blue light.

Combat with the Carnivore Plant is simple but in itself a puzzle. There are 3 stages:

1. Vines can only be destroyed with elemental magic, otherwise will take damage indefinitely. In this stage, the Thorns will using ranged attacks.
2. Thorns can only be dulled with melee weapons, otherwise will take damage indefinitely. At this point, the Bloom will be casting poisons and other conditions on the attackers.
3. The Bloom can only be plucked by unarmed melee or wind, otherwise will take damage indefinitely. The attacks here will be from other creatures as Carnivore Plant attracts reinforcements.
