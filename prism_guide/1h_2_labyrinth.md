# The Labyrinth

Behind the intruders, the door fades away. There's only one way out of the Labyrinth.

## Layout

### Room details

The Labyrinth shifts. Each time it is visited by intruders, 36 rooms are generated randomly, each containing two door features. Door features are:

* The sealed entrance, 1x.
* The exit, 1x.
* The dead end, 1x.
  * This is where the Beast Man rests.
* The Loop Door, 2x.
  * These are not physically connected, but the intruders will move to a non-adjacent room without being able to magically detect it.
* Open passages, 10x.
* Many more regular doors.

Each room is a 5x5 pace square.

The rooms will contain enemies, treasures, or maybe nothing at all. This is also determined when the Labyrinth is intruded. The odds are influenced by the door features, as follows:

|Door Feature|Enemy Count|Treasure|
|---|---|---|
|Sealed Entrance|0|1d20-20|
|Exit|0|1d20-20|
|Dead End|Boss|1d2-1|
|Loop Door|3d4-8|1d20-18|
|Open Passage|3d4-10|1d20-18|
|Door|3d4-8|1d20-20|

Odds are calculated based on the more exciting door in the room, meaning whichever is higher up the table.

The rooms are lightly controlled. The entrance, exit, and dead end will only have one other door feature: a normal door. The loop doors will have at least one normal door between them on the map. Rooms created by open passages will not have doors that lead to the same connected space. 6 of the 36 rooms have 3 door features. No regular doors will be on the perimeter, but the special doors may be on the perimeter.

## Egress

The door is freely open... if the intruder can find it.

## Puzzle: The Loop Door

The mystery of the Labyrinth is the Loop Door. It's the door that doesn't map right.

Casting 'Drop' on this door will grant the intruder the Labyrinthine Key.

The Labyrinthine Key is a legendary one-time-use key that has the ability to unseal or unlock anything.

The catch is that all other doors contain great dangers, as found in the following table:

|Roll|Result|
|---|---|
|1|A random invader immediately receives a malady.|
|2-10|1d4 Labyrinth Wraiths attack.|
|11-15|Ancient bones. The Beast Man moves 3 steps closer to the intruders.|
|16-19|Tsibree glyph seals the door.|
|20|Random relic weapon + 1. If AGY 15 check is failed, treated as ancient bones.|

## Boss: The Beast Man

The Beast Man rages in his domain.

He is not summoned, the intruders may find him or he may find them.

His love is power, his is disposed to Below.

Hostile and combative attitude.

If the intruders find the Beast Man at the dead end, they may fight or choose to run. The Beast Man follows the intruders. Each time the intruders move to a new room, so does he.

The Beast Man may be provoked by the intruders remotely if they leave a survivor in a room or trigger a trap. He will efficiently move toward the room where this most recently happened. If the Beast Man is in the same room as the intruders, he will follow them through any door.

Upon defeating the Beast Man, the intruders can find the Beast Man's Key. This will unlock the treasure chest in the dead end room. The Beast Man's treasure chest changes with the Labyrinth, and if the key is used in another instance of the Labyrinth that chest is sealed.
