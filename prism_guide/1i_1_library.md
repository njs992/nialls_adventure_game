# The Library

The door silently closes behind the patrons. They find themselves in a room with three other doors in the center of the three other walls. Rows of bookshelves are aligned in rows throughout the area. It is said that knowledge of all existence is contained within the Library.

An amber glyph, Ayvem, is found on the end of a bookshelf in each room.

Prism Keepers and scholars quietly browse books or sit quietly in comfortable chairs and at candle-lit desks.

## Layout

### Room details

Four near-identical rooms exist in metaphysical symmetry within the Library. Each is impossibly square. The walls each measure 15 paces with a door in the center of each.

The East- and Westward rooms have closets on the Eastern and Western walls, respectively.

Though the Library prefers the Above disposition, all are welcome. Each room has varying degrees of disposition:

1. The Southward room with a door leading to the Landing is disposed Beneath but Above receives no negative effects here.
2. The Northward room with a door leading to the Labyrinth has a stronger disposition Above.
3. The Eastward room is disposed Without.
4. The Westward room is disposed Within.

## Egress

All doors are freely accessed within the Library.

## Puzzle: The Tome of Knowledge

Knowledge of all existence can be found within the Library. The problem is that only the Librarian truly understands the indexing system, and she is rather unforgiving.

This puzzle is a scavenger hunt and results in either hints for any Prism floor, cures to any permanent condition, a stat point increase, or a very valuable book.

A series of skill checks will have to be successfully executed. Each check will reveal a clue for what the next skill check must be. An incorrect check or a failure may result in puzzle failure or initiate a combat encounter or other negative effect.

To initiate the hunt, a patron must whisper their query to an Ayvem glyph.

To succeed, the patron must seek learning from the library. Books will be found and interpreted by determining the correct check and passing said check. The checks will escalate in difficulty.

For each query type, the difficulty changes. The difficulty may be based on GM discretion.

### Checks

* Each check is randomly selected and a secret riddle will be formed to show the check type.
* Checks start at 6, and each successive check raises the target by 2.

### Queries

* Treasure Tome:
  * Standard 4 checks.
  * No allowed failures.
  * The 4th book is a Treasure Tome, though the patron may seek greater treasure with more checks.
  * The Treasure Tome is valued with a dice roll. Each hunt step adds a die. The die value is:
    * 4 or 5 steps: d4
    * 6 or 7 steps: d6
    * 8 or 9 steps: d8
    * 10 or 11 steps: d10
    * 12-19 steps: d12
    * 20 steps: d20
* Prism Hint:
  * Check count based on room:
    * Levels up to +/- 3: 6 checks
    * Levels up to +/- 6: 10 checks
    * Levels up to +/- 8: 14 checks
    * Levels +/- 9: 20 checks
  * The Prism Tome Pages will reveal how to begin the floor puzzle, how to summon the floor boss. Carrying the Prism Tome Page in inventory during the respective floor puzzle will grant boosted checks during the puzzle. The Prism Tome Page is not transferable within the Prism, under penalty of Malady.
* Stat point increase:
  * Check count is equal to the desired stat level. I.e. if the patron wants to increase Command from 13 to 14, it will require 14 checks.
  * Multiple patrons may help. All participants will increase the same stat, and the final check must be equal to or greater than the desired level.
* Condition Cure:
  * For Malady: the patron seeking healing must individually succeed on 8 checks.
  * For Injury: others in the party of the patron seeking healing must succeed on 8 checks.
  * The patron will be healed of their permanent condition upon the success of a 9th check, targeting 10 and influenced by the condition.
  * If the 9th check is a failure, the malady or injury will be replaced by a new malady or injury, immediately.
  * If the 9th check is a critical failure, an additional malady or injury will be immediately received by the patron seeking healing.

## Boss: The Librarian

The Librarian may not be a physically impressive presence, but she exudes a commanding aura. All near her feel constant tension. One wrong move and a swift punishment will be doled upon the offender.

The Librarian is order personified. She is disposed toward Above.

She is summoned by noise. Library patrons will issue warnings to each other, but upon 3 trespasses of not whispering she is provoked. She will also be provoked immediately by voiced or tonal invocation, except on critical success.

Preferably non-violent but combative attitude. If provoked during combat or by an invocation, she is combative.

Trespassers are forced to leave through the door they came, upward or downward.

The Librarian cannot normally be fully defeated, only subdued. Upon subduction the Librarian will grant a boons of stat points to each patron in the party. Each selected stat will improve by 1 and each patron may select any stat.
