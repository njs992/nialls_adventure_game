# Domains

There are physical locations in which Colors flourish naturally. Sometimes Domains are definite but other times they are fluid and situationally dependant. For example, if a given Color represents a concept such as conflict then the ideal Domain may be a battlefield which would vanish as soon as fighting stops.

Domains are the only way for a character to reach full Attunement through resonance. Thus it is only by GM design that a character can reach that. Attunement in domains is only affected by the primary and contrary domains of the Color of that character. Neutral domains and other domains do not affect Attunement.

## Neutral Domains

_"In Life are we all enabled. Power flows freely as we choose to walk our paths. In Death are we abated. Power is not to be found as we march, compulsed." --The Oracle_

There are two neutral domains: Life and Death. Death has been outlined in [Death](2diii_death.md). Life is the domain we walk in. The neutral aspect of Life is that Color power is never restricted or enhanced as long as one walks paths that do not reject or confirm the path of one's Color.
