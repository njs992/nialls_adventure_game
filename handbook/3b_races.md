# Races

A description of each race can be found in the [Races and Creatures](2b_races-and-creatures.md) section. This section goes over base stats, traits, and race powers for gameplay as each of the races.

The breakdown of the list below is as follows:

1. Statistic offset table. Each of these offsets apply to the randomized base statistics. They may push a stat into the next stat bonus range. These are applied after the class is selected, meaning the character's stats may not match the class stat order.
2. Automatic Race Traits. These apply to every character of the given race and affect the character as outlined. (To do...)
3. Racial powers. Each race has two options for a racial power. These will all be once-per-game usage. During character creation, one of these are to be selected.

Fast to Learn
