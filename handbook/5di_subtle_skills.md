# Subtle Skills

A character may want to subtly influence the actions of another. This can be done through a Subtle Skill.

## Subtle Rolls

Subtle rolls are made before gameplay. The GM will have a player take a D20 roll a number of times and use the results as banked skill checks for when the player chooses to use Subtle Skills.

## Using a Subtle Skill

When a player wishes to use a Subtle Skill, they will discretely signal to the GM what they wish to do. The GM then discretely applies the results of the skill, using a Subtle Roll D20 value for the needed check.

### Critical Successes and Failures

A critical success on a Subtle Skill means the skill works successfully and the character can not be exposed using the skill.

A critical failure on a Subtle Skill means the character makes an error while attempting the skill and is exposed to all characters involved. The value used for the check is the following D20 value from the banked Subtle Rolls. If the following D20 value is also a critical failure, it is a failure with no additional adverse affects.

### Exposed Subtlety

When a character is exposed for using Subtle Skills in an interaction, any following Subtle Roll checks are considered Attenuated.
