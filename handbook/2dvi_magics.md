# Magics

The magics are the supernatural forces that can be bound and controlled. Magics are best conceptualized as physical concepts that we expect to behave based on "natural law" but are actually ebbings and flowings of magical forces. For example, gravitational attraction seems like something that happens naturally but to the student of the magics it is understood as the balance held by great magisters and rulers, such as the Sun or the Earth, each obeying their greaters and executing within their granted region. Control over the magics is robbing the natural order and shaping the flow of magics to fulfill needs of the user.
Methods are detailed below but magics usage is outlined in [Gameplay](5_gameplay.md).

## Schools of Magics
Magisters, wizards, warlocks, whales, and any other student of magics generally conform their studies to specific Schools of Magics. Sometimes one School is near enough to another that some control may be easily adopted and adapted by an astute student. Common Schools of Magics are outlined below.

### School of Elements
From searing fire to howling wind, the School of Elements is the devotion of all those who seek to manipulate the physical world. Each student will specialize in a given element, such as water, and seek to understand the workings, reactions, and behaviors as they harness the natural power for themselves. As one is specialized, the names of magical methods are changed to reflect the element.

### School of Alchemy
Can water turn to gold? The student in the School of Alchemy seeks the answer. Transmutation, potions, and poisons come from these students, making it a socially highly acceptable and financially highly lucrative discipline. 

### School of Psyche
Students of the School of Psyche never lose sleep about whether someone will change their mind. These students want to do the changing. This is a highly dangerous discipline, as the more one delves into the mind of another, the more ones mind is lost. As the student's mind is lost, the student's control slips away and they become vulnerable to suggestion. Most students only deal in illusion, deception, and light trickery. Despite standing on these safe banks of the mind river, students are still at risk of being swept away in the current of madness. The sea-divers into the mind ocean are those who dabble in the methods of inception, deep mind manipulation, and forced madness.

### School of Living
The beating heart; the falling leaves. Students in the School of Living are often great healers and horticulturalists. Overwhelming goodness is found in this school, but as in all things the opposite dwells here as well. Necromancy is the dark underbelly of the School of Living, but all knowledge there is restricted and found only in ancient, dark tomes. The rest of these students look after well-being and fight the literal ills in society.
