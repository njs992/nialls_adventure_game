# Background

If the GM wants, players may pick a background. Backgrounds give a little context for the player character's... well... background! Backgrounds will lend a small stat bonus and trait to the player character. With GM discretion, a player may write and justify their own background, bonus, and trait.

## Backgrounds

### Ward

No parents, no family, you were raised by the streets. That is, until you were taken as the ward of a successful businesswoman in Keystad, a risen named Forthwyn. Her further success was in small ways enabled by you, and through your time with her you learned many helpful skills in getting by in the city.

|CMD +1|

Name Drop

- Knowing Forthwyn so well has it's perks. Everyone who's anyone in Keystad has heard the name and they either respect or fear her. Letting slip that you are so close with her will quickly gain you a friend in a tricky situation.
- Situational application: When convincing, persuading, or deceiving, roll a boosted CMD check.
- Out of combat, single use.

### Con Artist

Trying to get by was never easy. Being underprivelaged in Keystad while so many live in excess and look down on the poor led you to seek alternative income methods. Quick tricks, minor scams, many regrets, but some important skills were performed and acquired along the way.

- Fun background

- Out of combat, frequency?

### Scavenger

Were you on the run? Maybe stranded during an adventure? Imprisoned in the Keystad catacombs? Whatever it was, you thrived. Scavenging got you out yet you often dream of returning to the thrill of survival.

|HRT +1|

Recovery

- How did you survive? You found snacks under rocks, you feasted in caves, you fostered nutrition in barren landscapes. You haven't forgotten your tricks.
- Immediately following combat, recover 1d4 health.
- Out of combat, single use.

### Normie

That's right, you're normal. You were raised in a regular household, you were educated with your peers, you even apprenticed with the wayward carpenter next door. All you really want to gain from this quest of yours is a secure future.

### Best Friends

What makes you great is them. What they love about life is you! Not much more to it than that. No better group to embark on adventures with.

|Best Friend|
|---|
|Any +1|

Got Your Back

- There's no better way to fight than side-by-side with a friend.
- After another best friend is attacked and the opponent is within range, make a standard attack against this opponent. Got Your Back must not provoke an open target attack.
- Reflex action, once per best friend per combat.
