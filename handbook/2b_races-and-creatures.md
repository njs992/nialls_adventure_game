# Races and Creatures

Keystad is home to diverse races and many creatures.

## Races
The many races are essential to the function of society as they each bring many benefits to the factions. While each race is distinct from each other, each has many cultural and societal variations within itself. Capabilities between each race may differ, but within each they are equal. These are all playable as player characters and their specific game stats are outlined in section [3.b Races](3b_races.md).

### Human
The humans are the most populous group in Keystad. They are commonly found in each of the factions, though they aren't the founders of any faction. For this reason, humans are often seen as invaders and are sometimes dismissed as such. Human civilization is by no means as ancient as the other races, but their penchant for adaptability and acceptance is what brought other races, often referred to as "the Others," together into one society.
Humans excel in many skills equally. They can be relied on to take care of any task, but will often lack any specific task when compared to the race best fit for it.
Humans are special because of their unmatched resolve and adaptability. The human Second Wind has been reported to turn the tides of conflict in the face of impossible odds. Some humans are Fast to Learn and have been known to become experts in new skills in mere minutes of training.

### Ghoul
The ghouls had a lot to overcome to be accepted into society. After struggling to flourish without support from surface dwellers, they banded together and traded hard mining work for surface resources. Historically, they were the first of the Others to move into human society. They are now responsible for ensuring the cleanliness of Keystad. They are living beings, they prefer darkness, they stand at a medium stature, and they are skilled in non-ideal environments.
Ghouls naturally struggle in many ways as they evolved in a critically different environment from other races. Because of this they generally don't work well with others. They are physically strong and adept survivalists, so they are generally responsible for the safety of the rest of society. This includes many maintenance roles but they are also essential in extreme condition special operations in the Keystad Peace Operation.
All ghouls Life Energy Feed off of the energy of the recently dead, which scares many other races into believing that ghouls eat corpses. Some ghouls are still close to lesser evolved creatures and exhibit Monster Strength while others are more evolved and are capable of Environmental Neutralization, where they can protect those around them from toxins.

### Risen
Despite their name, it is often believed that the risen are descended from ancient cities in the clouds. Their often pompous attitude and reluctance to interact with other races kept them from mingling with the humans until recent eras. They encourage social behavioral correctness and extended that culture into beuracratic order, which the humans accepted as a necessary inconvenience. They do poorly in the dark, and thus the first advancement they brought to the humans was public lanterns, lighting Keystad at all hours. This led to many other conveniences and safety systems, such as the Kesytad Peace Operation and the Keystad Stability Initiative, which protect the lives and livelyhoods of all Keystad residents, equally.
The risen excel in precise skills. They are physically lacking but compensate in dexterity and leadership.
They channel magics readily by nature and risen have born with the ability to Ward Danger to protect those around them from peril. Others have been born with the ability to Channel Influence and have used that in taking advantage of those around them.

### Wayward
The wayward have long interacted with humans, though generally in secret. Their acceptance into society came quickly during an era of drought and famine when they realized they needed to emerge from obscurity and interact directly with human society. Previously their interactions with humans consisted of exercising their elemental magics to help humans tribes and villages flourish, then skimming the bounty in secret. The wayward's trademark feature is it's feline face and clawed hands, along with a small stature. They prefer to live in natural settings and struggle in Keystad's urban environment. They serve those in the city by offering protection in and resources from the outer lands.
Wayward are from a similar environment to humans and as such have developed similar capabilities. The key difference is that they culturally developed differently. Their egalitarian societies glorified the channeling and control of magics.
Some of the wayward have committed so fully to abilities with magics that they developed Key Weaknesses that may hamper their skills as a trade off for ease in channeling magics. Others have Heightened Senses that protect them in unfamiliar locations.

### Obser
The obser are a peculiar group. Records of their first contact with humans are riddled with holes and speculation. The only things that can be stated with surity are that they were third of the Others to contact the humans and they did it on their own terms. They are easily recognized: slight and pale beings with dark, beady eyes. Their integration into society has been unsettling to many, as they bring little to the table and generally fulfill roles that could have been and often were already filled by the humans.
A surprising thing about the obser is that you never quite expect them. They abruptly vanish and appear as they carry out their personal purposes.
Obser can seemingly Duplicate Item or even Duplicate Person, which has led to distrust in dealings with obser. These abilities are unconfirmed, but sometimes proof is abandoned when everyone is convinced of an assumed truth.
