## General Gameplay Mechanics and Terms

### Dice Rolling

#### Die Naming

Dice names refer to the number of sides. D6 is a 6-sided die, D20 is a 20-sided die, etc.

#### Boosted and Attenuated Rolling

When making a boosted roll, the player rolls two dice in place of one and selects the better of the two as the result.

An attenuated roll is similar, except from the two dice the worst of the two is taken.

Boosting and attenuating may apply to any roll. If multiple dice are used in the roll, multiple dice are used to compare.

Boosting and attenuating may stack or negate. For example, if a player is rolling with double attenuation they will roll three dice and pick the worst result of all three.

Note: the terms 'better' and 'worse' refer not to higher or lower numbers, but the more favorable and less favorable results to the player.

#### Critical Successes and Failures

A critical success, under base operations, is rolling a natural 20 on a D20 roll. This will always succeed and may result in positive bonus conditions.

Similarly, a critical failure is a natural 1 on a D20 roll and it always fails and may result in negative bonus conditions.

Certain traits or items may expand the critical range. This is always symmetric, meaning the failure and success ranges expand at the same time.
