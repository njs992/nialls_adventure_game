# Classes

Classes are multi-faceted and can be affected by both player level and Color saturation, see [Saturation](2dii_saturation.md). Certain classes are restricted by saturation level, and desaturation may affect class powers and abilities. See [Progression](4_progression.md) for an outline on saturation leveling.

## Class types

1. [Below Classes](3ci_below.md)
2. [Within Classes](3cii_within.md)
3. [Above Classes](3ciii_above.md)
4. [Without Classes](3civ_without.md)

## Class Structure

The class structures built in trees. Each division has its own trees, intertwining between starter classes to gain additional skills which may be taken at each level, depending on conditions. We'll have to clarify once the details are worked out.
