## Spellbinding

Spellbinding is the ability to combine Magics for greater effect. Combinations may empower the results, change the effects, or fail spectacularly and dangerously.

To spellbind, the player decides on which Magics they wish to use. The number of Magics depends on the Magics ability of the character, determined by the Might statistic, and the available action points. The order of selected Magics affects the outcome.

Spellbinding is completed with a HRT check based on the Magics selected, as seen in the Tome of Magics. Other statistic modifiers may come into play while executing the check.

### Spellbinding Power

Certain words in the Tome of Magics carry more power than others, and this affects the power of the bound spell. Words are assigned power levels from 1 to 4, depending on their natural Attunements.

Spellbinding power is derived from a character's Might and Heartiness statistic. Though a character may bind up to as many words as they have Might, the success depends on the specific words' power.

Spellbinding power is calculated as follows: (3 * Might) + HRT bonus.

### Spellbinding Check
