# Statistics

Statistics are broken into two classifications: Primary and Secondary. Level and Color are also technical statistics, but are covered in their respective sections.

## Primary Statistics

Primary stats are: Power, Agility, Command, and Heartiness.

Primary stats are used to add bonus to rolls and defend against specific rolls. As an example:
Say two characters are competing in a wrestling bout. On an attempted throw, the attacker may make a Power roll against the defender. A D20 would be thrown and the number on it would be augmented by the Power ability bonus of the attacker, explained in the table below. For this to have been a success against the defender, it may be compared against their Power stat.
Using numbers:
The attacker has a Power stat of 17 and the defender has a Power stat of 13. The attacker attempts to throw with a D20 roll of 11. With the +2 bonus, this becomes 13. A 13 or higher is needed for success against the defender's Power stat of 13, so the throw succeeds!

|Stat Range|Bonus|
|---|---|
|20+|+4|
|18-19|+3|
|16-17|+2|
|13-15|+1|
|9-12|0|
|7-8|-1|
|5-6|-2|
|2-4|-3|
|1|-4|
|0|Auto-fail|

### Power [POW]

Power represents ability regarding application of force. Throwing a stone, kicking down a door, lifting an anvil... there are many situations where one may need Power.

### Agility [AGY]

Brute force may be helpful in many situations, but sometimes precision will take you farther. Agility is avoiding the swung axe. Agility is jumping to safety. Agility is the equal and opposite reaction to Power.

### Command [CMD]

The persuasive capabilities of Command are for those who see value in intellectual strength. There is no need to kick the door down if the keeper opens it for you. Having a follower's shield block the axe is more reliable than dodging it.

### Heartiness [HRT]

## Secondary Statistics

### Defense [DEF]

Defense applies to all physical attacks. It is the value that an incoming attack roll must match or exceed in order to land a hit.
Defense is calculated as follows:

|(Agility Statistic) - (Agility Bonus)|
|---|

Examples: An Agility statistic of 14 will result in an Agility bonus of +1 and a defense of 14 - 1, 13. A terrible Agility statistic of 6 gives a bonus of -2 and a defense of 6 - (-2), 8.

### Fortitude [FOR]

Defense applies to all non-physical or magical attacks. Just like defense, t is the value that an incoming non-physical or magical attack roll must match or exceed in order to land a hit.
Likewise, fortitude is calculated in the same way except using the Heartiness statistic.

|(Heartiness Statistic) - (Heartiness Bonus)|
|---|

### Speed [SPD]

Speed refers to how far a character can move during a turn of combat. Speed is only affected by status effects and racial or class traits.

|Base Speed is 6|
|---|

<!-- ### Fight, Skill, and Soul [F, K, S] <REPLACE WITH MIGHT!>

Fight is a special bonus from classes that will give additional bonus in combat and survival situations. Similarly, Skill gives bonuses in non-combat and puzzle situations. Soul is a bonus applied to control of magics and provides bonuses to magical attack method damage, magical recovery method healing, and a bonus for other magical method checks.
This may be affected by uncommon special items and status effects, but is primarily affected by class selection.  -->

### Might

Might is the ability of a character to act. As Might increases, a character can combine more spells, attacks, or effects in order to augment power. Might is increased with progression in the class skill trees from 1 to a natural maximum of 3. Saturation and Attunement can give bonus Might as well as a Might penalty. When using Might, additional checks may need to be made such as Spellbinding.

#### Spellbinding

Spellbinding is a check based on the connected Magics. Each Magic will have a modifier statistic that defines the check target and roll.

#### Combination Attack

Using Might to string together attacks into a Combination Attack gives bonuses to each successive hit. Critical Failure at any point ends the Combination Attack, but normal failures just reset the Combination Attack bonus. The Combination Attack bonus adds extra damage range to the damage roll of the attack, or gives a direct bonus or penalty to the attack's check. Extra damage range is an additional die roll of 1d-bonus level. Check bonuses and penalties are just +/- bonus level, depending on whether the character or the target are making the check. In head-to-head checks, only the character gets the bonus and no penalty is given to the target.

## Stat Assignment

At character creation, stat assignment is determined by class and by dice rolls. The class determines the stat order. For example, the Miner class has a stat order "PHAC." This means your highest stat goes to Power, next to Heartiness, then Agility, and lowest to Command. After this, racial offsets apply.
Stat assignment works by rolling 5d4, 4 times, excluding the lowest rolled die, and assigning the value to the appropriate stat. For example if the dice rolled "2, 3, 4, 1, 3," the 1 would be removed from the total and 12 would be assigned. 

Idk about this, open to suggestions
