# Combat

Combat is run on a turn-by-turn basis. Each playerA turn during combat may be comprised of multiple parts: full actions, partial actions, null actions, movement, and reflex.

## Full Action

A full action is a a major activity with potential for massive impact. When taking a full action two partial actions are used, reflex is used upon a success, and movement is reduced to half.

### Special Moves

There are no standard special moves, all special moves are found as item or class abilities.

### Big Attacks

Most big attacks belong to specific classes. There are only two standard big attacks.

#### Two-handed Attack

- Make a melee attack with the full strength of two hands. Must only have a single melee weapon equipped. With a penalty to hit of -3, succeed on an attack roll against the opponent. Upon success, roll double damage dice (damage modifier only applies once.)

#### Takedown (initiate grapple)

- Executing a takedown to initiate grapple. Grappling engagement rules are listed in the [special combat](5aiii_special_combat.md) section. Upon a success, act as though a Throw was successfully executed. If the attacker has the Grappler trait, the defender receives the Stunned condition.

## Partial Action

This is your simple actions and standard attacks. These categories include item usage, most class abilities, equipping, and combat-time skill checks.

### Simple Moves

Drinking a potion.

Equipping an inventory item.

Skill checks, such as for footing on uncertain ground or jumping from a height.

Prepare a magics method.

### Standard Attacks

#### One-handed Attack

- POW roll against DEF. Damage dealt based on weapon stats.

#### Ranged Attack

- HRT roll against DEF. Damage dealt and range based on weapon stats.

#### Unarmed Attack

- AGY roll against DEF. 1 damage dealt.

#### Simple Burst of Magics

- CMD roll against FOR. Damage dealt based on Soul, range up to 3 strides, no magics preparation.

#### Lock (initiate grapple)

- AGY roll against AGY. Initiates grappling. Grappling engagement rules are listed in the [special combat](5aiii_special_combat.md) section.

## Null Action

Null actions include everything that takes no effort. Examples include communication or dropping an equipped item.

## Movement

Movement is standard by race.

## Reflex

Reflex moves are actions taken by the player character during other player character turns. These can be pivotal to controlling the battlefield. Upon a critical success, the opponent ends their turn immediately.

### Reflex Moves

#### Quick Grab

If an item is within a character's unarmed melee range, is not equipped by another character, and the character has an open hand, the character may attempt a quick grab. An uncontested quick grab succeeds on an AGY check. A contested quick grab is determined by an AGY roll against the AGY stat of the character with the higher base AGY stat. If more than two characters use their reflex to contest a quick grab, the two characters with the highest base AGY stats contest, all others auto-fail. Any failure expends a reflex.

#### Prevent

As an opponent within melee range makes any ranged attack or takes a simple or a reflex move, roll POW against AGY to prevent. Attempts to prevent a full action are rolled attenuated. A successful prevent results in the opponent expending all actions with no results. Prevent may be used on any action of a friendly character, though an attempt may harm your relationship.

### Reflex Attacks

#### Disengagement Attack

As an opponent moves out of melee range, make a standard attack against them.

#### Open Target Attack

As an opponent within melee range makes any ranged attack or takes a simple or a reflex move, make a one-handed attack or unarmed attack against them.

#### Prepared Attack

As an opponent moves into range, make a standard attack against them. This requires a partial action from the player character's last turn to be kept for this reason. Any standard attack may be prepared.

#### Counter-punch

Upon a melee failed attack against a player character with a free hand, the player character may use a reflex to counter-punch with a standard unarmed attack if the attacker was within unarmed range.

#### Shield-block

A defending player character may use a reflex to increase their defense by an amount given in the shield's stats.

#### Shield-bash

After a failed incoming attack, a player character may use a reflex to shield-bash. On a successful POW roll against AGY, deal 1 damage and the attacker loses their reflex.
