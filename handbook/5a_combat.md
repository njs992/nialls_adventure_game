# Combat

## Actions

A turn during combat may be comprised of multiple parts: full actions, partial actions, null actions, movement, and reflex.

### Full Action

A full action is a a major activity with potential for massive impact. When taking a full action two partial actions are used, reflex is used upon a success, and movement is reduced to half.

Standard full actions:

Two-handed Attack

* Make a melee attack with the full strength of two hands. Must only have a single melee weapon equipped. With a penalty to hit of -3, succeed on an attack roll against the opponent. Upon success, roll double damage dice (damage modifier only applies once.)

Takedown (initiate grapple)

* Executing a takedown to initiate grapple. Grappling engagement rules are listed in a section below. Upon a success, act as though a throw was successfully executed. If the attacker has the Grappler trait, the defender receives the Stunned condition.

### Partial Action

This is your simple actions and standard attacks. These categories include item usage, most class abilities, equipping, and combat-time skill checks.

#### Simple Actions

Drinking a potion.

Equipping an inventory item.

Skill checks, such as for footing on uncertain ground or jumping from a height.

Prepare a magics method.

#### Standard Attacks

One-handed Attack

* POW roll against DEF. Damage dealt based on weapon stats.

Ranged Attack

* HRT roll against DEF. Damage dealt and range based on weapon stats.

Unarmed Attack

* AGY roll against DEF. 1 damage dealt.

Simple Burst of Magics

* CMD roll against FOR. Damage dealt based on Soul, range up to 3 strides, no magics preparation.

Lock (initiate grapple)

* AGY roll against AGY. Initiates grappling. Grappling engagement rules are listed in a section below.

### Null Action

Null actions include everything that takes no effort. Examples include communication or dropping an equipped item.

### Movement

Movement is standard by race.

### Reflex

Reflex moves are actions taken by the player character during other player character turns. These can be pivotal to controlling the battlefield. Upon a critical success, the opponent ends their turn immediately.

Below are the standard reflex moves.

#### Disengagement Attack

As an opponent moves out of melee range, make a standard attack against them.

#### Open Target Attack

As an opponent within melee range makes any ranged attack or takes a simple action, make a one-handed attack or unarmed attack against them.

#### Prepared Attack

As an opponent moves into range, make a standard attack against them. This requires a partial action from the player character's last turn to be kept for this reason. Any standard attack may be prepared.

#### Counter-punch

Upon a melee failed attack against a player character with a free hand, the player character may use a reflex to counter-punch with a standard unarmed attack if the attacker was within unarmed range.

#### Shield-block

A defending player character may use a reflex to increase their defense by an amount given in the shield's stats.

#### Shield-bash

After a failed incoming attack, a player character may use a reflex to shield-bash. On a successful POW roll against AGY, deal 1 damage and the attacker loses their reflex.
