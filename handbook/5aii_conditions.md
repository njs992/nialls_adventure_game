# Conditions

Conditions refer to status effects applied to a player character that will affect how the character can function. They may be modifiers to ability checks, they may affect how others can interact with the character, and in many cases they make the character's time will be made difficult. On the other hand, a character may have a condition that adds a benefit. This may help the character during checks or make checks against the character more difficult.

## Standard Conditions

Standard conditions are overcome or maintained by a condition check. If the specific condition applies a modification to ability checks, checks made to overcome or maintain that condition are not affected by it.

Out of combat, conditions will only affect ability checks so the check is made each ability check. Positive and negative conditions have slight differences for their condition checks.
