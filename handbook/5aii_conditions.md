# Conditions

Conditions refer to status effects applied to a player character that will affect how the character can function. They may be modifiers to ability checks, they may affect how others can interact with the character, and in many cases they make the character's time will be made difficult. On the other hand, a character may have a condition that adds a benefit. This may help the character during checks or make checks against the character more difficult.

## Standard Conditions

Standard conditions are overcome by a condition check. If the specific condition applies a modification to ability checks, checks made to overcome that condition are not affected by it.

Check difficulty changes in two different ways. In combat, the condition check is made at the beginning of each turn. Out of combat, conditions will only affect ability checks so the check is made each ability check. Positive and negative conditions have slight differences for their condition checks. Details will be in their respective sections below.

### Positive Conditions

Critical successes revert the check level to 1. Critical failures on condition checks immediately remove the condition.

|Check Level|Target|
|---|---|
|1|Any|
|2|5|
|3|10|
|4|15|
|5|20|

### Negative Conditions

Critical successes on condition checks immediately remove the condition. Critical failures revert the check level to 1.

|Check Level|Target|
|---|---|
|1|20|
|2|15|
|3|10|
|4|5|
|5|Any|
