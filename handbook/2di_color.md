# Color

_"None sees clearly; all thoughts are obscured by the tint of Color." --The Oracle_

Color is the disposition that influences actions, desires, and nature.

All things have Color but sometimes Color can seem ambiguous or is difficult to recognize.

Color may render to an observer differently from one experience to the next, but through Color all things are tied together and power can be found.

The impact of Color on an individual is derived from [Attunement](2dii_attunement.md) and [Saturation](2diii_saturation.md).
