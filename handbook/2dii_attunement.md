# Attunement

Attunement leads to massive increase in power. Creating resonance or dissonance leads or prevents one from reaching attunement. It is achieved by finding resonance in one's actions and can be used proactively to increase power or passively to affect every move made.

Attunement is primarily a tool for the GM to encourage good role-playing and punish uncharacteristic choices. The powers and abatements of Attunement are outlined in [Gameplay](5_gameplay.md).

## Resonance

Resonance is finding peace through one's true Color.
Acts of resonance:

* Activity in the natural domain of one's Color.
* Acting in ways that directly bring one toward their desire.
* Pushing forward the general cause of one's Color.

## Dissonance

Dissonance is introduced when one acts contrary to their desires.
Acts of disonnance:

* Activity in the contrary domain of one's Color.
* Making choices that block one from reaching their desires.
* Behaving contrary to one's Color.

## Attunement Charms

The bonuses of resonance and pentalties of dissonance come from the character's Attunement Charms. Attunement Charms are easily identified by physical manifestations but are, in reality, bestowed purely as spells.
