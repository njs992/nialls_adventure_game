# Attunement

Attunement leads to massive increase in power. Creating resonance or dissonance leads or prevents one from reaching attunement. It is achieved by finding resonance in one's actions and can be used proactively to increase power or passively to affect every move made.

Attunement is primarily a tool for the GM to encourage good role-playing and punish uncharacteristic choices. The powers and abatements of Attunement are outlined in [Gameplay](5_gameplay.md).

## Resonance
Resonance is finding peace through one's true Color.
Acts of resonance:
* Activity in the natural domain of one's Color.
* Acting in ways that directly bring one toward their desire.
* Pushing forward the general cause of one's Color.

## Dissonance
Dissonance is introduced when one acts contrary to their desires.
Acts of disonnance:
* Activity in the contrary domain of one's Color.
* Making choices that block one from reaching their desires.
* Behaving contrary to one's Color.
