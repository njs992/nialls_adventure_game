# Special Combat

In some combat situations rules of engagement change and moves change. Outlined below are the situations and terms of these different engagement methods.

## Grappling

When a grapple is initiated the involved parties must make grapple-type moves instead of the standard combat moves. Grappling may be aided by the [Grappler](3c_classes.md) trait.

While grappling, the move costs are slightly different.

- The combat order changes for the two involved in the grapple. Both characters take their moves consecutively. Starting when the grapple is begun, the character with the higher AGY stat goes first. The defending character will get a turn immediately after the attacker initiates, but they do not gain any actions or reflexes if they have already used theirs during the current round of combat.
- Simple actions are restricted completely during a grapple.
- Reflex actions may only be used against the grapple opponent.
- Large equipped items are immediately dropped by both characters. Items such as daggers, gauntlets, scrolls, or any similar small, handheld item may be held during grappling or dropped as a null action.

During a grapple, both characters occupy the same space. Other characters can assist through aid and offense, but there may be unintended consequences on failures.

- Aiding a grappler
  - A successful AGY check is required to administer aid to a grappler.
  - A failed check results in administering aid to the wrong target.
- Attacking a grappler
  - A successful AGY check is required to attack a grappler.
  - A failed check results in attacking the wrong target.
  - After the check, the attack is executed as though the target were not grappled.
  - No grapple initiations may be made.
  - If an attack deals damage to the grappler, the other grappler may roll boosted on a roll to break the grapple.

### Initiating a Grapple

A grapple is initiated via standard combat moves. For convenience, these are repeated here.

#### Takedown, full action
