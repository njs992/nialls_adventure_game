Purple was the earliest seen color. When the humans emerged from their gray-scale views the first thing they saw was death, darkness, and dankness in their caves and hovel shelters. This grim outlook revealed the color purple to their eyes.

It's only fitting that the first of the others that they met were the ghouls. The ghouls live and thrive with purple. They were born in it, they have been shaped by it, and they follow it.

## Primary Directive

To bring down those above.

## Magics Command

The below commands the magics through means of instrumental music.

When exercising magical methods as a below class:

- An instrument must be equipped.
- Instrumental magics are always treated as ranged, even if the target is within reach.
- Critical failures result in shattered instruments.
- All methods may become multi-targeted, though all nearby entities are effected.
- Whistling may be used as substitute for instruments in some situations.

  - Heavy instruments are equipped as other equipment. Two-handed use.
  - Light instruments may be equipped and safely unequipped and stowed with a null action, given available hands. Two-handed use.
  - Small instruments are one-handed instruments that otherwise are treated like light instruments.
  - Stationary instruments are emplaced in the environment.
- Play, how it is used. Effective range is based on 2x the instrument type check bonus.
