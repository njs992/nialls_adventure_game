# Levels

Leveling a character can be achieved through various paths and brings many benefits.

Leveling in Niall's Adventure Game is simple and consistent, provides relatively small power boosts, and player characters are limited to 4 levels. Generally, a 3 level difference will lead to one-hit kills. Levels 5-7 are generally reserved for non-player characters.

## General Level-up

The following list is executed at each level up. The order of operation is as listed. Levelling up takes place only at the beginning of a game. Upon level up:

- +1 to any statistic.
- +1 action point.
- Add < skill bonuses total > max health points.
- Check Saturation level-up condition.
- Add class power from class tree.
