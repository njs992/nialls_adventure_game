# Levels

Leveling a character can be achieved through various paths and brings many benefits.

Leveling in Niall's Adventure Game is simple and consistent, provides relatively small power boosts, and player characters are limited to 4 levels. Generally, a 3 level difference will lead to one-hit kills. Levels 5-7 are reserved for non-player characters.
