## What's Niall's Adventure Game?

Niall's Adventure Game (NAG?) is a table-top adventure game, formed from the ideas that the creator, Niall, got while playing other table-top adventure games! These include things like Dungeons and Dragons 5e, Pathfinder, and Baldur's Gate 3, as well as some friend-made games such as Castle Adventure.

## What are some key features of Niall's Adventure Game?

Big question! We'll dip into a handful of the main selling points, but further detail is available in the handbook.

### Gameplay

The gameplay of NAG is intended to be a driving experience in both role-playing and combat situations. In role-playing situations, rewards and punishments will be given for player behavior. These are based on the certain character attributes that are assigned during character creation and explicitly lined out. Combat, too, has explicit responses to things such as critical success and failures. Further, combat is designed and streamlined to be a faster-moving turn based system, focused on player engagement throughout the turn cycle.

### Narrative World

NAG is based in the city of Keystad and the nearby regions. The Oracle tells us about Color which guides choices in life and death. Everyone feels the effects of Color based on their personal Attunement and Saturation, which unlock more power or potentially limit power.

The denizens of Keystad are the founding humans, as well as "the others" -- ghouls, risen, wayward, and obser. Each race brings benefits to society with their individual strengths and weaknesses.

### Focused Theme

Who's making the decisions? NAG is focused on choices, effects, and accountability. In the false-utopian city, many factions believe they are in charge. Who's calling the shots? What's affecting their decisions? How will your choices impact the city? Are we choosing for ourselves or are we being influenced?
