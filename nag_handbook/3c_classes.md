# Classes

Classes are multi-faceted and can be affected by both player level and Color saturation, see [Saturation](2dii_saturation.md). Certain classes are restricted by saturation level, and desaturation may affect class powers and abilities. See [Progression](4_progression.md) for an outline on saturation leveling.
