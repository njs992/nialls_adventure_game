# Saturation

As power increases, so may Saturation. Saturation is commitment to a Color and deeper saturation often either leads to radicalism and zealotry or is pursued through types of fanaticism. Saturation brings power in Colors in ways that often are combative toward the other Colors or percieved as such by the other Colors. Mechanics of Saturation increase in gameplay is found in [Progression](4_progression.md).

## Ritualistic Saturation
Ritualistic Saturation is acting as though greater Saturation is reached. By some Colors this is encouraged but by others it is viewed as blasphemy. It sometimes is used as the vehicle for increase in Saturation.

## Desaturation
If power is lost, Saturation may be lost as well. This is a natural occurance. Although legend speaks of the power to desaturate, there is no understanding of such an ability.
Some seek to lose Saturation through Attunement dissonance, but this is universally seen as an affront to the Color of the perpatrator and results in conflict.

## Under-saturation
Attempting to use the power of greater Saturation often results in serious harm to the user. This is outlined in [Gameplay](5_gameplay.md).
