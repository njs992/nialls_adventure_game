# Death

Death is the neutral domain, contrary to life. Color has no power in Death except to draw the dead to peace.

## In Death
The Oracle's followind quote is experienced by all who pass into Death:
_"An expanse of gray envelopes you. As darkness becomes light, you are drawn toward a beautiful horizon--the physical embodiment of the Color that guided you in life now literally guides your steps as you march, endlessly, to the horizon. Reaching your Color grants you peace and paradise." --The Oracle_

## Dead Wanderers
As stated by The Oracle, those who are dead march endlessly in search of the horizon where they will find peace. There is no way to tell if the wanderers ever reach their destination, but The Oracle seems to think not. This ethereal domain is populated by silent masses of these wanderers.

## Death Walkers
There are legends of those who choose to find and walk in Death of their own accord. The allure of power comes from the idea that Dead Wanderers can be harvested for power or brought back into life as Soul Servants. In reality, necromancy actually carried out by trapping souls as the victim is killed.
