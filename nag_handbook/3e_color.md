# Color
Color alignment is determined by the selected class.

## Attunement
Attunement is judged on a scale from 1-6. A player character begins at an attunement of 3, neutral. Througout a given game this level may move up and down. At the start of the next game, attunement automatically moves one step toward neutral. GM discretion is the primary influence on level, though some guidance will be given.

### Levels

1. Complete Dissonance
* Complete dissonance is a denial of one's Color. Consequences of reaching complete dissonance include: 
    - Immediate desaturation, not temporary.
    - All skill checks made with attenuated rolls.
    - Unable to recover health.
    - Skill bonuses no longer apply to checks.

2. Dissonant
* Dissonance comes from acting out of line with one's Color.
    - Skill bonuses no longer apply to checks.

3. Neutral
* Neutral is the state of one who's Color is neither aiding or acting against their goals.

4. Resonant
* When one's will comes in line with their Color, resonance is achieved.
    - May expend resonance, return to neutral, and either re-roll a check or take a boosted roll.

5. Harmonic
* Harmonic resonance is achieved when every action one takes promotes their Color.
    - May expend resonance, return to resonant, and either re-roll a check or take a boosted roll.
    - All rolls for damage are done twice, taking the preferred of the two results.

6. Attuned
* When one is attuned to their Color, all things become clear and one's purpose is unified with Color.
* This level is unattainable without being in one's Color Domain, and upon exiting that domain the player character's attunement returns to harmonic.
    - May expend resonance, return to harmonic, and either re-roll a check or take a boosted roll.
    - All rolls for damage are done twice, taking the preferred of the two results.
    - All skill bonuses are doubled.
    - Saturation level temporarily raised one level.

### Attunement Changes
GM discretion is the primary driver of attunement level.
Standardized attunement shifts come from specific conditions being met to either raise or lower attunement.

#### Attunement Up
* Presence in one's Color Domain.
* Executing a primary directive of one's Color.
* Achieving a personal primary directive.

#### Attunement Down
* Presence in one's opposite Color Domain.
* Assisting a primary directive of one's opposite Color.
* Preventing a primary directive of one's Color.

## Saturation
Saturation levels are determined primarily based on one's Color. Levels will mean different things to different Colors. Unless otherwise specified by GM, players start at 0: White
